# Rum ToDo Sample Application

Very basic (no styling), but fully functioning, TodoMVC using Rum. Created by
Christopher Gsell because he could not find a TodoMVC repo using just Rum for
state control. Code design and benchmarks were used for his thesis comparing
ClojureScript libraries.


### Development Build
